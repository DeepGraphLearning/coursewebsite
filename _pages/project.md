Course Project
==============

Students should form groups with 2-3 people to finish their course projects. Each group work on a specific research topic, read relevant literature, and discuss the topic. After the class, each group should finish a research report (NIPS/ICLR format) with maximum 8 pages. The proposal should include introduction, problem definition, related work, methodology, experiments, and conclusion.
